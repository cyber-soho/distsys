## How to Run

### Python Examples

```bash
# Make sure Python 3 is installed
python3 --version

# Run any Python example
python3 example1_coffee_shop_distributed.py
python3 example2_food_delivery_distributed.py
python3 example3_transparent_search.py
```

### Bash Examples

```bash
# Make the scripts executable (first time only)
chmod +x example4_system_info.sh
chmod +x example5_node_health_check.sh
chmod +x example6_fhs_explorer.sh

# Run any Bash example

## Example Descriptions

### Example 1: Coffee Shop Distributed System
Demonstrates the three core characteristics of distributed systems:
- **Concurrency**: Multiple shops serving customers simultaneously
- **No Global Clock**: Each shop has its own local clock
- **Independent Failures**: One shop can fail without affecting others
- **Message Passing**: Shops communicate to check inventory

### Example 2: Food Delivery Distributed System
Implements the three distributed system models:
- **Architectural Model**: Microservices architecture (OrderService, PaymentService, LocationService)
- **Fundamental Model**: Failure handling, timeouts, message loss simulation
- **Physical Model**: GPS tracking, network latency simulation

### Example 3: Transparent Search System
Shows how transparency hides complexity:
- **Location Transparency**: User doesn't know which data center serves them
- **Replication Transparency**: Multiple index copies exist invisibly
- **Failure Transparency**: Automatic failover to backup servers
- **Concurrency Transparency**: Multiple users search simultaneously

### Example 4: Linux System Information Script
Gathers comprehensive system information:
- Operating system and kernel details
- Hardware information (CPU, RAM, disk)
- Network configuration
- Package manager detection
- Distributed systems tools check

### Example 5: Node Health Check Script
Monitors system health for distributed environments:
- CPU usage monitoring with thresholds
- Memory usage tracking
- Disk space analysis
- Network connectivity checks
- Service status monitoring

### Example 6: FHS Explorer Script
Interactive exploration of the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard:
- Tours key directories (/etc, /var, /home, /proc, etc.)
- Shows directory purposes and contents
- Provides quick reference for troubleshooting
- Checks for installed distributed systems tools

---

## Prerequisites

### For Python Examples
- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external libraries required (uses only standard library)

### For Bash Examples
- Bash shell (version 4.0+)
- Standard Linux utilities (ps, top, free, df, etc.)
- Some examples may need root/sudo for full functionality
